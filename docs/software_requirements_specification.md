# Software Requirements Specification

## Purpose

This application provides a platform for all lifelong learners to manage their personal learning objectives. By utilizing Learning Journeys, users can group objectives and self-evaluate and reflect upon their learning during and after a Learning Journey. Additionally, Personal Learning Objective Manager helps users in identifying and monitoring their strengths and areas of development in their chosen Learning Journeys.

## Users

Personal Learning Objective Manager is an offline desktop application intended for a single user. Currently, no distinct user roles are deemed necessary.

## Additional Features planned for future development:

- **View archived Learning Journeys:** Currently, archiving a Learning Journey is a *point of no return*. An archive view would benefit learners who wish to get back on track with their archive Learning Journeys.
- **View only finished/unfinished Objectives during a Learning Journey:** Especially with Learning Journeys with a lot of Objectives, the learner might find some clarity when only finished or unfinished Objectives are displayed during moments of reflection.
- **Permanently delete a Learning Journey:** By default, learners are encouraged to revisit their Learning Journeys, which are only marked as 'passive' upon closing. However, sometimes it might be necessary to delete a Learning Journey for good.
- **More options for ordering closed Learning Journeys:** Ordering by time helps users to look back and revise older Learning Journeys - seeing how far one has become might spark motivation in the darkest of times! Ordering by degree of challenge can help users retake a Learning Journey they found too challenging before.
